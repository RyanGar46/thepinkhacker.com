# About Me

Hi, my name is Pink. I'm a self taught programmer with many years of experience.

## My Dev Journey

I first found my passion with Minecraft&mdash;or more specifically&mdash;the technical side of the game.
Very quickly after getting the game I started learning the built in scripting language of the game.
This taught me some basic concepts about computer science.

I worked on many small projects that only I ever saw. It wasn't until I joined
[CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com) in which I started to create projects for other people.
In 2018, I started off by [recreating the Tardis](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/worlds/tardis)
from the popular show Doctor Who. This used many of my skills with the builtin scripting language.

A video game's scripting language will only get you so far.
I decided to put an effort towards creating something both a larger demographic would enjoy and
utilize an actual programming language.
This put me towards [Classic 3D](/project/classic-3d), my now most popular project.

Classic 3D, is an addon for Minecraft that improves the visuals of the game by adding more detailed models.
It extensively relies on a build tool to reduce the verbose nature of resource packs.
When I first built Classic 3D in 2019, I started creating a script called
[Resource Pack Packer](https://github.thepinkhacker.com/resource-pack-packer) (<abbr>RPP</abbr>).
<abbr>RPP</abbr> started off as a small python script, but later turned into a full program.

Throughout 2018 and 2019, I learned how to use Unity, but I never shipped anything significant.
I did learn C# which felt like a better Java.
Later, I would abandon the engine since I disagreed with Unity's decisions.

During 2021, I took my first computer science class and promptly didn't learn anything new.
Surprising that after "studying" for three years prior, I would get a 5 on a AP course.

In 2022, I started learning how to create [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net) mods for Minecraft.
These are written in Java and can anything about the game.
I started off by creating a small mod called [Commands+](/project/commands-plus).
This built on the scripting langue in Minecraft.

After getting experience with Fabric mods, I started a bigger project.
Later I would put it on the back burner, but I created [Apollo](/project/apollo).
It's my own take on a space mod for Minecraft.

By 2022, I had experience with websites, C#, Java, and Python.
I only learned these as a way to get something done, not because I enjoyed using them.
I learned of Rust from YouTube and was very interested.
I liked Java for it's static nature, but it was overly verbose and non-native.
Python made most tasks simple, but heavily relied on runtime checks with little static analysis.
Rust felt like a balance between these two worlds.
I decided to make an investment into learning Rust.

<abbr>RPP</abbr>, my resource pack build script for Minecraft, was overly bloated.
Fairly quick, I came to the conclusion that Python was getting in the way.
Anyways, I would have to rewrite the entire program from scratch to debloat it.
So I start rewriting <abbr>RPP</abbr> in Rust.
First, I attempted it in 2022 and later in 2023, but I lacked a good enough understanding of Rust.
It wouldn't be until mid-2024 in which I would start building a *working* spiritual successor
called [MCPacker](https://github.thepinkhacker.com/mcpacker).

While <abbr>RPP</abbr> had a strong focus on an inheritance based workflow,
MCPacker focuses more on a composition workflow.
A resource pack is comprised of many "bundles".
Each bundle can be used in many different builds of a pack.
For instance, Classic 3D Redux[^1] has a bundle for each version of the game to allow for supporting
a wide range of Minecraft versions.

## My Current Skills

Primarily, I'm a Rust developer. I also have experience with the Minecraft modding <abbr>API</abbr> known
as Fabric using Java.

My Rust libraries

I'm able to use Python, but I tend to avoid it for anything more than simple scripts.

Nuxt/Vue is my side adventure. I don't like the web ecosystem, but Vue is well made.
I only learned it to make this [website](/) and nothing more.

I use Linux[^2] and the terminal extensively with every project I work on.
[Neovim](https://neovim.io/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/), and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) get me through the day.

[^1]: Classic 3D rebuilt from the ground up with MCPacker instead of <abbr>RPP</abbr>.
[^2]: btw i use arch.
