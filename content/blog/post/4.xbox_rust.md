# Xbox + Rust

In my [last blog post](/blog/post/xbox), I uncovered my old Xbox. Briefly, I mentioned my desire to create a demo for the console. I can say I'm now working towards that goal. But, I couldn't make it easy though.

## NXDK

The [New Xbox Development Kit](https://github.com/XboxDev/nxdk) (<abbr>NXDK</abbr>) aims to build an open-source <abbr>SDK</abbr> for the original Xbox. This allows new games to be created for the console without using Microsoft's proprietary <abbr>SDK</abbr>.

The project is currently being developed in C. This proves difficult, given that I'm a die hard Rust fanatic, I rather not learn C nor make a project with it. This corundum guided me towards one solution: Rust bindings for <abbr>NXDK</abbr>.

## Rust Bindings

Surely, someone else smarter than me has created bindings, right? Sadly, this is only kind of the case. GitHub user [antangelo](https://github.com/antangelo) started this [endeavor](https://github.com/antangelo/nxdk-rs) a bit more than two years ago in 2022. They were able to get a simple hello world program up and running. However, they didn't get much further than this. A majority of the <abbr>SDK</abbr> remains unbinded.

This presents two options: either use the fully ready to use C/C++ <abbr>SDK</abbr>, or continue development on the Rust bindings. You probably can guess which plan I choose to go with.

Rust has a trick up it's sleeve. There's a macro that takes a C header file and creates unsafe functions out of them. These can be used to implement a more idiomatic Rust API built on the unsafe C functions. For example, this is what the following C function would get converted to:

```c
int addOne(int value) {
    return value + 1;
}
```

```rust
unsafe fn addOne(value: i32) -> i32 {}
```

Importantly, this isn't converting the actual underlying code of the functions. This just allows you Rust code to interact with the C functions. You would then want to create a safe function that grantees safety. In this case it would be really simple.

```rust
fn add_one(value: i32) -> i32 {
    let ret;

    unsafe {
        ret = addOne(value);
    }

    ret
}
```

## Forking The Bindings

I created a [fork](https://github.thepinkhacker.com/nxdk-rs) in order to start implementing new functions. My first goal was the Hardware Abstraction Layer (<abbr>HAL</abbr>). This includes very low-level functions such as debug printout in the terminal. Debug print and video initialization functions where already setup.

The first header I decided to implement was the <abbr>LED</abbr> functions. There are only two of them. Focusing on just one of them, here you can see a real example of implementing a safe <abbr>API</abbr> for Rust. The C function takes 4 colors which are actually just signed 32-bit integers. This can seem misleading though. The colors green, orange, red, and off are represented by the numbers 0-3. So every other input is undefined behavior, something Rust programers frown upon. In order to resolve this undefined behavior, I created an enum. While it just represents a signed 32-bit integer, the Rust API has no way of giving unexpected inputs, resolving the undefined behavior.

```rust
use nxdk_sys::hal::led::*;

#[derive(Debug, Default)]
enum LEDColor {
    #[default]
    Off = _XLEDColor_XLED_OFF as isize,
    Green = _XLEDColor_XLED_GREEN as isize,
    Red = _XLEDColor_XLED_RED as isize,
    Orange = _XLEDColor_XLED_ORANGE as isize,
}

fn xset_custom_led(color1: LEDColor, color2: LEDColor, color3: LEDColor, color4: LEDColor) {
    unsafe {
        XSetCustomLED(color1 as i32, color2 as i32, color3 as i32, color4 as i32);
    }
}
```

As a sanity check, I implemented some of the debug functions to confirm I was doing everything correctly. I was able to confirm the `debug_print_binary` function in [XEMU](https://xemu.app).

```rust
use nxdk_rs::hal::{video::*, debug::*};

let msg = format!("Hello from {}!\n", "Rust");

xvideo_set_mode(640, 480, 32, RefreshRate::Default);
debug_print_str(&msg);

debug_print_binary(0b1010);
```

I've continued this process to other <abbr>HAL</abbr> headers, but many are still unimplemented. Anyways, the <abbr>HAL</abbr> isn't the only important code that needs Rust bindings. <abbr>SDL2</abbr> is included in the <abbr>SDK</abbr>. It's by far the most complicated and important piece of it. <abbr>SDL</abbr> opens up the ability to create 3D/hardware-accelerated graphics with DirectX. Also, it handles user input and many other aspects important to a game engine. Without it, making a video game&mdash;or demo&mdash;becomes very difficult.

## What's Next

I'm still not the most knowledgeable on this topic. I'll need to look more into if it's possible to use the <abbr>SDL2</abbr> crate or if I'll need to recreate the bindings myself.

Currently, I'm going through the process of upgrading the 8GB <abbr>HDD</abb> to a 1TB <abbr>SDD</abbr>. This is proving harder than expected, so who knows when there will be a post up on that. If I get it working, expect to see a post about it. In the process of that, I also got FTP setup, but that's for another time.

Another side project I'm working on is fixing my old broken controllers. Many of the cables went bad. I just desoldered the cables and am waiting for replacements to be shipped. I should be able to start working on them within the next two weeks or so.
