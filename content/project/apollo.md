Me and many other people loved space mods like Galacticraft, but they're on old versions of Minecraft. Apollo is a space mod the utilizes newer aspects of Minecraft like custom worlds through datapacks. Apollo is still actively developing and improving. I will take feedback, but remember that early on there will be many placeholder features and textures.

## Features

- The Moon
- Meteorites
- Spacesuit
- Low gravity
- Custom data-driven skybox

## Planned Features

- Fuel refining
- More planets
- An API to allow for expansion datapacks and mods to be created


## Bleeding Edge

If you would like a bleeding edge version of Apollo, they can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/RyanThePinkHacker/Apollo-MC/actions). They're automatically created anytime a change is pushed. Click on the version you would like and download the artifacts. This will be a zip file containing the mod. Bleeding edge may be **unstable** so use a backup of your world or create a new world.

## Feedback:

If you have found a bug or have an idea of how Apollo can be improved, then go to the [GitHub](https://github.com/RyanThePinkHacker/Apollo-MC/issues) page and fill out a ticket.
