## Additional Info

The only official website for Classic 3D is [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/classic-3d); don't download Classic 3D from any other website.

This resource pack works best with [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium). This dramatically improves the frame rate in complex areas like the nether.

Suggestions and technical issues should be filed on [GitHub](https://github.thepinkhacker.com/classic-3d-redux/issues).
