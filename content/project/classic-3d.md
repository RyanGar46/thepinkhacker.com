## Info

The only official download websites for Classic 3D are [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/classic-3d), [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/classic-3d) and [Planet Minecraft](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/classic-3d-4384051/). Don't download Classic 3D from any other website.

This resource pack works best with [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium). This dramatically improves the frame rate with complex large areas like the nether.
